# LM Studio Setup Guide

Run NeverEndingQuest using your local LM Studio instead of OpenAI's API. This eliminates API costs and allows you to run the game completely offline with open-source models!

## Overview

NeverEndingQuest supports two connection methods:

### Method 1: Direct Connection (Recommended - Simple & Fast)
```
NeverEndingQuest → LM Studio (port 1234)
```
Direct connection with zero overhead. This is the easiest and fastest method.

### Method 2: Proxy Connection (Advanced - Optional Capture and Debugging)
```
NeverEndingQuest → mitmproxy (port 8080) → LM Studio (port 1234)
```
Routes through a proxy. Optional payload capture can be enabled for
troubleshooting; it is disabled by default.

## Quick Start (Windows)

### ✨ Method 1: Direct Connection (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Setup LM Studio:**
   - Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
   - Load a model (recommended: Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, or similar)
   - Click "Start Server" in the Local Server tab (bottom-right)
   - Verify it says "Server running on port 1234"

2. **Launch the game:**
   - Double-click `run_with_lmstudio_direct.bat`
   - Start playing!

**That's it!** No proxy setup, no mitmproxy installation. Just LM Studio + the game.

---

### Method 2: Proxy Connection (Advanced)

**Use this method if you need to:**
- Debug API calls
- Log requests and responses
- Troubleshoot model compatibility issues

**Setup:**

1. **Setup LM Studio** (same as Method 1 above)

2. **Install mitmproxy:**
   ```bash
   pip install mitmproxy
   ```

3. **Choose your launch style:**

   **Option A: One-Click Launch**
   - Double-click `launch_lmstudio_mode.bat`
   - Two windows will open automatically
   - If payload capture is explicitly enabled, capture files are saved to
     `lmstudio_logs/`

   **Option B: Manual Launch**
   - Terminal 1: Run `start_lmstudio_proxy.bat` (starts proxy)
   - Terminal 2: Run `run_with_lmstudio.bat` (starts game)

## Prerequisites

### Method 1 (Direct) - Required Software

1. **LM Studio** - [Download here](https://lmstudio.ai/)
   - Free local LLM runtime
   - Windows, Mac, or Linux

2. **Python 3.8+** - Already installed if you can run NeverEndingQuest

### Method 2 (Proxy) - Additional Requirements

3. **mitmproxy** - Install via:
   ```bash
   pip install mitmproxy
   ```
   Only needed for the advanced proxy method.

### Recommended Models for NeverEndingQuest

Good models to try (available in LM Studio's model browser):

| Model | Size | Context | Performance | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Mistral 7B Instruct** | 7B | 32K | Excellent | Best all-around choice |
| **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** | 8B | 128K | Excellent | Great for long sessions |
| **Phi-3 Medium** | 14B | 128K | Very Good | Good balance |
| **Mistral Nemo** | 12B | 128K | Excellent | Great storytelling |

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 16GB RAM for 7B models
- 32GB RAM for 13B+ models
- GPU recommended but not required

## Configuration

### Changing LM Studio Port

If your LM Studio runs on a different port (default is 1234):

1. Open `lmstudio_forwarder.py`
2. Find line 20: `LM_STUDIO_PORT = 1234`
3. Change to your port number
4. Save and restart the forwarder

### Optional Payload Capture

Payload capture is disabled unless you explicitly set the environment
variable `NEQ_LMSTUDIO_CAPTURE_PAYLOADS` to `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on` before
starting the forwarder. If the variable is absent, blank, false, or invalid,
capture remains disabled and the forwarder does not create payload capture
files. Captured prompts, responses, headers, and authorization credentials may
be sensitive; enable this only for deliberate troubleshooting.

When enabled, capture files are written under the project-local
`lmstudio_logs/` directory beside the forwarder, regardless of the caller's
current working directory. Normal forwarding does not require capture.

### Advanced: Different LM Studio Host

If running LM Studio on a different machine:

1. Open `lmstudio_forwarder.py`
2. Line 19: Change `LM_STUDIO_HOST = "localhost"` to your IP address
3. Make sure LM Studio's server is set to listen on `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`

## How It Works

### Component Breakdown

**1. openai_patcher.py**
- Monkey-patches the OpenAI Python library
- Redirects all API calls to `http://localhost:8080`
- No changes to game code needed!

**2. lmstudio_forwarder.py**
- mitmproxy addon that runs on port 8080
- Intercepts redirected calls
- Forwards them to LM Studio on port 1234
- Optionally logs requests/responses

**3. LM Studio**
- Runs the actual AI model locally
- Provides OpenAI-compatible API on port 1234
- Processes all game prompts

## Troubleshooting

### "mitmproxy is not installed"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install mitmproxy
```

### "The forwarder proxy does not appear to be running"

**Causes:**
- Forwarder proxy window was closed
- Port 8080 is in use by another application

**Solution:**
1. Make sure `start_lmstudio_proxy.bat` is running in a separate window
2. Check if another program is using port 8080:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   ```

### "Connection refused" or "Cannot connect to LM Studio"

**Causes:**
- LM Studio server is not started
- LM Studio is using a different port
- No model is loaded in LM Studio

**Solution:**
1. Open LM Studio
2. Go to the "Local Server" tab (bottom-right icon)
3. Make sure a model is loaded
4. Click "Start Server"
5. Verify it says "Server running on port 1234"

### Game is slow or responses are weird

**Causes:**
- Model is too small (< 7B parameters)
- Model doesn't follow instructions well
- System prompt is too large for model's context

**Solutions:**
1. Try a different model (Mistral 7B Instruct recommended)
2. Enable compression in NeverEndingQuest's `config.py`
3. Use a model with larger context window (32K+)

### SSL/Certificate errors

**Cause:**
- mitmproxy certificates not trusted

**Solution:**
The forwarder uses `--ssl-insecure` flag, so this shouldn't happen. If it does:
1. Check that `mitm_config/` directory exists
2. Restart the forwarder

## Performance Tips

1. **GPU Acceleration:**
   - LM Studio automatically uses your GPU if available
   - NVIDIA GPUs work best (CUDA support)
   - AMD GPUs work via ROCm
   - Apple Silicon Macs work great with Metal

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Larger models = better quality but slower
   - Smaller models = faster but less creative
   - 7B-8B models are the sweet spot

3. **Context Length:**
   - Enable NeverEndingQuest's compression system
   - Use models with 32K+ context for longer sessions
   - Compression reduces token usage by 70-90%

4. **LM Studio Settings:**
   - In LM Studio's server settings, increase "Max Tokens" to 2048+
   - Adjust temperature (0.7-0.9 works well for D&D)
   - Enable prompt caching if available

## Cost Savings

Running locally with LM Studio eliminates all API costs:

- **OpenAI GPT-4:** ~$0.03-0.06 per 1K tokens
- **LM Studio:** $0.00 (free!)

**Typical Session Costs:**
- 4-hour game session with GPT-4: $5-15
- Same session with LM Studio: $0

**Hardware Investment:**
- One-time cost of GPU (if not already owned)
- RTX 3060 12GB: ~$300 (runs 7B models well)
- RTX 4060 Ti 16GB: ~$500 (runs 13B models well)
- Pays for itself after 20-100 hours of gameplay vs GPT-4

## Logs and Debugging

### Request Logs

Only when `NEQ_LMSTUDIO_CAPTURE_PAYLOADS=true` (or another recognized true
value) is explicitly configured:

- Requests/responses may be saved to: `lmstudio_logs/lmstudio_capture_TIMESTAMP.jsonl`
- Forwarder activity may be logged to: `lmstudio_logs/lmstudio_forwarder.log`

These files can contain sensitive prompts, responses, headers, and credentials.
No payload logs are created by default.

### Viewing Logs

The following files exist only after payload capture has been explicitly
enabled with `NEQ_LMSTUDIO_CAPTURE_PAYLOADS`:

```bash
# View latest capture (Windows)
type lmstudio_logs\lmstudio_forwarder.log

# View latest capture (Linux/Mac)
tail -f lmstudio_logs/lmstudio_forwarder.log
```

## Switching Back to OpenAI

To switch back to using OpenAI's API:

1. Close both LM Studio windows (forwarder and game)
2. Run the game normally:
   ```bash
   python run_web.py
   ```

Your `config.py` OpenAI API key will be used automatically.
