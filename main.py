# ============================================================================
# MAIN.PY - GAME LOOP CONTROLLER
# ============================================================================
#
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Primary Controller in MVC Pattern
#
# This is the central orchestrator of the 5th edition Dungeon Master system, implementing
# the main game loop and coordinating all subsystems. It follows the Command Pattern
# where every game interaction is processed as a discrete action.
#
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Game session management and main loop execution
# - Action parsing and routing to appropriate handlers
# - AI response validation with NPC codex integration
# - Conversation history management and context compression
# - Module transition processing with timeline preservation
# - Real-time user feedback and status reporting
# - DM Note generation for authoritative current game state
# - AI-powered NPC validation system coordination
#
# DM NOTE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
# - AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE: DM Note contains current, dynamic game state
# - REAL-TIME DATA: Always reflects most up-to-date character information
# - AI CLARITY: Single source of truth prevents conflicting information
# - DYNAMIC FOCUS: HP, spell slots, conditions, and active effects
#
# DM NOTE CONTENT STRATEGY:
# Generated content includes:
#   - Current party status (HP, level, XP, spell slots)
#   - Active location and environmental conditions
#   - Time, date, and world state information
#   - Dynamic character states (not static reference data)
#
# INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE:
# - DM NOTES: Current state, real-time data, authoritative information
# - SYSTEM MESSAGES: Static character reference (conversation_utils.py)
# - SEPARATION PRINCIPLE: Prevents AI confusion from version conflicts
#
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Coordinates with dm_wrapper.py for AI interactions
# - Uses action_handler.py for command processing
# - Manages state through party_tracker.json updates
# - Validates responses using multiple AI models with NPC codex verification
# - Integrates with ModulePathManager for file operations
# - Provides dynamic data to conversation_utils.py for context management
# - Leverages npc_codex_generator.py for AI-powered character validation
#
# DATA FLOW:
# User Input -> Action Processing -> AI Response -> NPC Codex Validation -> State Update -> DM Note Refresh
#
# This file embodies our "AI-First Design with Human Safety Nets" principle
# by combining powerful AI capabilities with rigorous validation layers and
# clear information architecture that prevents AI confusion.

1. For interactions happening AT the current location, ONLY use NPCs from the "PRESENT at current location" list
2. Hidden or revealable authored NPC identities from current-location investigation hooks count as PRESENT at the current location for validation purposes
3. For references to NPCs at OTHER locations, they must exist in the "NPCs at OTHER locations" or module character lists
4. NEVER create new NPCs - all names must exist in the provided lists
5. If an NPC is referenced incorrectly, suggest the CORRECT NPC from the current location list
6. NPCs cannot be in multiple locations simultaneously - verify location consistency

CHARACTER NAME RULES FOR updateCharacterInfo:
- ALWAYS use the FULL character name exactly as it appears in the party tracker or NPC lists
- For party NPCs, use their complete name (e.g., "Scout Kira" not "kira", "Sir Aldric" not "aldric")
- For party members, use the exact name from partyMembers list
- NEVER shorten or modify character names in action parameters
- If a character has a title or descriptor, it MUST be included (e.g., "Scout Kira", "Knight Commander Marcus")
