# Architecture Decision Records Index

This directory captures durable Tabletop NeverEndingQuest architecture decisions.

Status legend:
- Accepted: active decision currently guiding implementation
- Planned: approved direction not fully implemented
- Superseded: replaced by a later accepted ADR
- Deferred: intentionally postponed

## Supersession Map

- ADR-0023 supersedes ADR-0028.
- ADR-0026 is the planned successor to ADR-0025.

## Notes

- Scope intentionally excludes upstream ARCHITECTURE documents and focuses on tabletop and v2 decisions.
- Change-level implementation details remain in `openspec/changes/*`.
- Canonical governance remains in `AGENTS.md`.
