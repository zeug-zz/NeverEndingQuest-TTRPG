# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Content Generation Layer - Location Content Creation
#
# This module provides AI-powered area and location generation with integrated
# map layouts, creating comprehensive location files that serve as the
# foundation for the module-centric geographic architecture.
#
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - AI-driven area and location content generation
# - Map layout creation and ASCII map integration
# - Schema-compliant area file structure creation
# - Geographic relationship management within modules
# - Location feature and description generation
# - Integration with module builder for complete location systems

ROOM LIST TO NAME:

NAMING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create unique, memorable names that fit the module's theme
2. Names should be 2-4 words maximum  
3. Avoid generic terms like "Room 1" or including IDs
4. Consider the room's function and connections
5. Names should feel immersive and atmospheric
6. Use evocative adjectives (Ancient, Forgotten, Shattered, etc.)

EXAMPLES OF GOOD NAMES:
- entrance -> "Weathered Gate Chamber"
- throne room -> "Sunken Crown Hall" 
- corridor -> "Whispering Passage"
- shrine -> "Altar of Lost Hopes"
- marketplace -> "Merchant's Circle"

**Initial Concept Name:** "{initial_name}"

**Area Details:**
- Type: {config.area_type}
- Danger Level: {config.danger_level}

**TASK:**
1.  **Refine the Name:** If the initial name is too specific (like a single building or landmark), broaden it into a more general, evocative name for the entire region. For example, if the initial name is "The Old Lighthouse," a better regional name would be "The Shipwreck Coast" or "The Cursed Headlands." If the initial name is already good for a region, you can keep it or make minor improvements.
2.  **Write a Description:** Write 1-2 atmospheric sentences for the refined area name. The description should capture the area's character, include sensory details, and match the danger level.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- The refined name should describe a whole AREA/REGION, not a single location.
- The description must be for the refined name.

**Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:**
{{
  "refinedName": "Your New, More General Area Name",
  "description": "Your 1-2 sentence atmospheric description."
