    Plot points are the key story beats that drive the adventure forward.
    Each plot point represents a major decision point or revelation.
    
    Typically include 4-8 plot points that:
    - Build upon each other logically
    - Allow for player choice (branching paths)
    - Escalate tension toward climax
    - Include both combat and non-combat challenges
    
    Example plot point:
    {
        "id": "PP001",
        "title": "The Missing Miners",
        "description": "The party learns that several miners have vanished in the

            }
        ]
    }
    
    Key principles:
    - Each point should present a problem or revelation
    - Description should be 3-5 sentences
    - Include what players learn and what choices they face
    - Connect to specific locations (by locationId)
    - May include side quests that start at this plot point

    4. Potential complications
    5. Hooks to next plot points
    
    Example:
    "The party discovers a bloodstained journal in the abandoned overseer's 
    office. Its pages detail strange visions and mentions of 'the burning 
    whispers' that drove miners mad. The final entry, dated three days ago,

    - 0 next points: Conclusion or dead end
    
    Example: ["PP003", "PP004"] means players could go to either PP003 or PP004 next
