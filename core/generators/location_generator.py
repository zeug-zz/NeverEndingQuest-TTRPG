    2. Key visual features  
    3. Atmospheric details (sounds, smells, temperature)
    4. Notable objects or areas of interest
    5. Hints at danger or opportunity
    
    Example:
    "The chamber stretches thirty feet across, its vaulted ceiling 
    disappearing into darkness above. Ancient stone pillars, carved 
    with worn dwarven runes, support the weight of centuries. A musty 
    smell mingles with the faint scent of sulfur, while water drips

    Triggering one releases poison darts (DC 13 Dex save, 2d4 poison 
    damage). The sealed door requires the proper ritual phrase or DC 20

1. Connect logically based on the map layout

6. Feel cohesive as part of the same {area_data.get("areaType", "area")}

Return a JSON object with a 'locations' array containing all complete location objects.
Each location must include ALL required fields from the location schema.

CRITICAL: Field names must match the schema EXACTLY:
- Use "npcs" NOT "notableNPCs" (must be array of objects with name, description, attitude)
- Use "monsters" NOT "creatures"
- Use "lootTable" NOT "items" (must be array of strings, not objects)
- Use "connectivity" for room connections
- Use "areaConnectivity" for connections to other areas
- Use "areaConnectivityId" for area connection IDs (empty array [] if no connections to other areas, NEVER include current area ID)
- Use "plotHooks" NOT "clues"
- Use "dmInstructions" for DM-specific notes
- Use "doors" for door information (ALL fields required: name, description, type, locked, lockDC, breakDC, keyname, trapped, trap)
- Use "traps" for trap details (must include detectDC, disableDC, triggerDC, damage)
- Use "dcChecks" in format "SkillName DC XX: Description"
- Include "accessibility" (describe how easily the location can be accessed)
- Include "dangerLevel" (must be "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Very High")
- Include "features" (array of objects with name and description)

DOOR STRUCTURE: Every door must have ALL these fields:
- name (string): e.g., "North Door", "Secret Panel"
- description (string): physical appearance
- type (string): e.g., "regular", "secret", "heavy"
- locked (boolean): true or false
- lockDC (integer): difficulty to pick (0 if not locked)
- breakDC (integer): difficulty to force open
- keyname (string): what opens it (empty string if none)
- trapped (boolean): true or false
- trap (string): trap description (empty string if not trapped)

AREA CONNECTIVITY RULES:
- areaConnectivityId should be [] for locations that don't connect to other areas
- Only include other area IDs when location explicitly connects to different areas
- NEVER include the location's own area ID in areaConnectivityId

Check the location schema carefully for all required fields.
